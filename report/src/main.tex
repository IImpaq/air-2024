  \section{Introduction}

  TODO Add an introduction here.

  \subsection{Motivation}

  The digital entertainment landscape has transformed, with unprecedented content production and availability.
  However, this abundance of choice has become a burden for consumers. Streaming platforms prioritize user retention
  over satisfaction, resulting in suboptimal viewing experiences.

  \noindent Content discovery is challenging due to cognitive load from navigating extensive catalogs across multiple services.
  Existing recommendation systems exhibit biases towards platform-specific content and popular titles, wasting user time.
  Industry data shows the average user spends 20 minutes per session browsing for content, accumulating lost time.

  \noindent Factors exacerbate the problem:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Accelerating content production with billions invested in new content.
    \item Algorithmic recommendations prioritizing platform engagement over user satisfaction.
    \item Limited cross-platform content discovery solutions.
    \item Inadequate consideration of contextual viewing preferences.
    \item Lack of efficient recommendation systems.
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent A user-centric approach is needed, prioritizing user time and preferences over platform metrics.

  \subsection{Research Question}

  This project addresses a central research question:
  How can we build a central system using a transformer-based architecture to process natural language queries,
  to generate personalized movie recommendations and efficetly reduce the users effort of finding matching content?

  \noindent This question encompasses advanced natural language processing, maintaining recommendation relevance, and system
  adaptability through user feedback. It directly addresses creating a more efficient and user-centric content discovery
  platform while acknowledging technical complexity in processing user preferences and ensuring system responsiveness.

  \section{Experiments and Results}

  To evaluate the performance, feasibility, and efficiency of our system, a series of experiments were conducted.
  A standardized questionnaire was employed to assess the system’s performance. Each group member independently evaluated
  the system.
  The evaluator initially considered the movies (genres, actors, mood) they would like to watch. They then completed the
  questionnaire to document their expectations for recommendations.
  Next, the evaluator navigated through the application to locate the recommended movies. Finally, they completed the
  questionnaire once more to document the actual recommendations received.
  A subjective comparison of the anticipated and actual recommendations was conducted. This comparison encompassed the
  following aspects:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item To what extent did the system comprehend the user’s query?
    \item Were there any unfamiliar movies recommended by the system?
    \item How accurately did the system recommend movies that aligned with the user’s query?
    \item To what extent did the system recommend movies that the user would find enjoyable?
    \item To what extent did the system recommend movies that the user was already familiar with?
  \end{itemize}

  \noindent This evaluation process was repeated over five days to identify a movie for each evening’s viewing.
